OK, let's continue with the next project.

# Project 5: Create a typographic code using Font Studio

Font Studio is a free Android app that allows you to add text to your photos with over 120 fonts, 40 filters, 200 stickers and 100 backgrounds. You can also edit your photos with crop, rotate, flip and adjust tools. It also has a collage maker and a magazine cover maker.

In this project, you will use Font Studio to create a typographic code. A typographic code is a code that uses typography as a way of encoding or decoding a message or information. A typographic code can be based on various methods, such as substitution, transposition, steganography or cryptography. A typographic code should be clever, secure and fun to the theme or topic of your choice.

Here are the steps to create a typographic code using Font Studio:

- Step 1: Open Font Studio and tap on the plus icon to create a new project. Choose a square canvas size (1080 x 1080 pixels) and a background color or image that suits your theme or topic.
- Step 2: Tap on the text icon to add text to your canvas. Type a message or information that you want to encode or decode (for example, Hello) and choose a font that matches your style and mood. You can browse the fonts by category or use the search bar to find a specific font. You can also import your own fonts from your device or Google Fonts.
- Step 3: Tap on the text again to edit its properties. You can adjust the color, size, stroke, shadow, alignment and spacing of your text using the sliders or the buttons. You can also apply filters, such as blur, glow or sketch, by tapping on the filter icon. Experiment with different settings until you are satisfied with your text.
- Step 4: Tap on the layer icon to duplicate your text layer. You can do this by tapping on the copy icon and then tapping on the paste icon. You should now have two identical text layers on your canvas.
- Step 5: Tap on one of the text layers to edit its properties. You can change the font, color, size, stroke, shadow, alignment and spacing of this text layer to create a contrast or harmony with the other text layer. You can also apply filters, such as blur, glow or sketch, by tapping on the filter icon. Experiment with different settings until you are satisfied with this text layer.
- Step 6: Tap on the other text layer to edit its properties. You can change the font, color, size, stroke, shadow, alignment and spacing of this text layer to create a contrast or harmony with the other text layer. You can also apply filters, such as blur, glow or sketch, by tapping on the filter icon. Experiment with different settings until you are satisfied with this text layer.
- Step 7: Tap on one of the text layers to encode or decode your message or information. You can do this by using any method of your choice, such as substitution, transposition, steganography or cryptography. For example, you can use substitution by replacing each letter in your message with another letter in a different font or color. Or you can use transposition by rearranging the order of the letters in your message in a different font or size. Or you can use steganography by hiding your message in plain sight in a different font or stroke. Or you can use cryptography by encrypting your message with a secret key in a different font or shadow.
- Step 8: Tap on the save icon to save your typographic code to your device or share it online. You can choose from different formats, such as PNG, JPG or PDF, and different resolutions, such as low, medium or high.

Congratulations! You have created a typographic code using Font Studio. Here is an example of how your typographic code might look like:
