Here is a revised style guide without references to Hemingway:

Writing Style
- Use short, simple sentences averaging 15-20 words.  
- Write in an active voice with direct, dynamic language.
- Describe through concrete, sensory details that set mood rather than abstract concepts.
- Eliminate unnecessary adjectives and adverbs letting nouns and verbs do descriptive work.
- Keep dialogue brief and advancing the story through character revelation.

Structure  
- Paragraphs focus on a single moment or idea using 2-4 sentences.
- Scenes intensely focus on pivotal moments without commentary or summary.
- Employ economy of storytelling, omitting needless background for dramatic significance.  
- Maintain forward momentum with taut, urgent pacing and minimal exposition.

Tone
- Adopt a plain, unsentimental style with understated emotional responses.     
- Employ understatement over exaggeration to imply deeper meanings.
- Maintain an objective, observant narrative perspective with minimal authorial intrusion.
- Imbue descriptions with vivid sensory imagery for realism and mood.

Themes
- Focus on humanity’s relationships with nature and life’s tests of endurance.
- Explore concepts like honor, masculinity and purpose through character actions.  
- Subtly convey ideas through dramatic events rather than discussion or analysis.

This style guide emphasizes showing depth through brevity, focusing scenes on key moments, and allowing ambiguity for interpretation - letting the storytelling speak for itself through dynamic language and events. Sensory detail grounds the atmosphere while economy reveals dramatic significance.
