## Prose Style 

### Structure of Sentences and Paragraphs:

- Sentences tend to be on the shorter side, averaging between 15 to 20 words in length. This helps to keep the writing moving at a brisk pace. 

- The writing is usually in the active voice, which utilizes more direct and dynamic verbs. This gives the prose a sense of forward momentum and urgency.

- Paragraphs focus on either a single moment in the story or one central idea. They contain roughly 2 to 4 sentences of content each.

- Key scenes are written so as to intensely focus on pivotal or important moments within the narrative. There is little commentary or summarization included. 

- An economy of storytelling is employed. This means unnecessary background details are omitted in order to emphasize dramatic significance. 

- Forward narrative momentum is maintained through relatively taut pacing and minimal explanatory text or exposition.

### Tone and Mood:

- The style is meant to be plain and straightforward with emotional responses understated rather than overtly sentimental.

- Understatement is utilized more so than exaggeration, allowing certain meanings or implications to lie subtly beneath the surface.

- The narrative perspective aims to be objective and observant while keeping authorial intrusion or commentary to a minimum.  

- Descriptions rely on vivid sensory imagery and concrete details to effectively set the atmosphere and mood.

### Themes and Subject Matter:  

- Recurring themes often center around humanity's relationships with nature or advancing technology, as well as life's challenges and tests of endurance. 

- Concepts such as honor, masculinity, and finding purpose are routinely explored through the actions and experiences of characters.

- Ideas are conveyed subtly through dramatic events in the story rather than through direct discussion, philosophical musings, or analysis.

In summation, this style emphasizes showing greater depth and complexity through brevity, focusing key narrative moments, and allowing some ambiguity for reader interpretation. Authentic sensory details and economical word choice balance simplicity with significance.
