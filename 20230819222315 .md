Thanks for the initial details. Here is a draft of the first iteration prompt:

# Write an extremely detailed, comprehensive and verbose typography tutorial aimed at absolute beginners who have no prior knowledge of typography or design. Start from the very basics and progress to pro-level typography knowledge. Explain all terminology, concepts and techniques in an easy to understand yet highly informational tone and style. Go in-depth on topics like the anatomy of type, classifications and terminology, principles of typography, using type effectively, typographic hierarchies, pairing fonts, typographic design for various mediums and applications, typographic trends and history, developing an eye for good typography, and any other relevant topics that should be covered in a complete guide to mastering typography from start to finish.

To further refine this, here are some additional questions:

Should the tutorial focus on typography for print design, digital design, or both?
Do you have a target length or word count in mind for the full tutorial?
Are there any specific applications, mediums or uses of typography you want to make sure are covered?
Let me know your thoughts and I'll refine the prompt further for the next iteration!
