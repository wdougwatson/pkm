example, you can pair Impact with Zapfino or Cooper Black with Helvetica.

- Use fonts that have different roles or functions. This is a common and effective way to pair fonts, as they create hierarchy and harmony by separating and connecting different types of text. For example, you can pair a serif font for body text with a sans serif font for headlines or a script font for captions with a display font for titles.
- Use fonts that have different moods or personalities. This is an adventurous and expressive way to pair fonts, as they create variety and harmony by contrasting and complementing different tones and styles. For example, you can pair a playful font with a serious font or a elegant font with a casual font.

### Typographic Design for Digital Mediums and Applications

Typographic design for digital mediums and applications is one of the most relevant and dynamic fields of typography. Digital mediums and applications offer new possibilities and challenges for typography, such as interactivity, responsiveness and accessibility. Digital mediums and applications also require specific considerations and adaptations for typography, such as resolution, screen size and device type. Here are some tips for typographic design for digital mediums and applications:

- Use web fonts or system fonts. Web fonts are fonts that are hosted on a server and can be downloaded by a browser or an application. System fonts are fonts that are installed on a device and can be accessed by a browser or an application. Both web fonts and system fonts have advantages and disadvantages, such as availability, compatibility, performance and quality. A good rule of thumb is to use web fonts for custom or creative designs and system fonts for standard or functional designs.
- Use relative units or breakpoints. Relative units are units of measurement that are based on the size of the parent element, the viewport or the root element. Breakpoints are points where the layout or style of a design changes based on the width or height of the viewport. Both relative units and breakpoints have advantages and disadvantages, such as flexibility, consistency, complexity and usability. A good rule of thumb is to use relative units for fluid or adaptive designs and breakpoints for fixed or responsive designs.
- Use contrast or color modes. Contrast is the difference in brightness or color between text and background. Color modes are the ways that colors are represented by numbers in digital devices, such as RGB (red, green, blue) or CMYK (cyan, magenta, yellow, black). Both contrast and color modes have advantages and disadvantages, such as visibility, readability, legibility and aesthetics. A good rule of thumb is to use high contrast for light or dark modes and appropriate color modes for print or screen modes.
- Use accessibility or usability features. Accessibility is the degree to which a design can be used by people with disabilities or impairments. Usability is the degree to which a design can be used by people with different skills or preferences. Both accessibility and usability features have advantages and disadvantages, such as inclusivity, functionality, simplicity and complexity. A good rule of thumb is to use accessibility features for universal or ethical designs and usability features for personal or practical designs.

## Typographic Trends and History Relevant to Digital Design

Typographic trends and history are one of the most fascinating and inspiring aspects of typography. Typographic trends are the current or emerging styles or movements in typography that reflect the culture, technology and society of a certain time or place. Typographic history is the past or established styles or movements in typography that influenced the development, evolution and innovation of typography over time. Both typographic trends and history are relevant to digital design, as they can provide context, insight and inspiration for our typographic choices and expressions. Here are some examples of typographic trends and history relevant to digital design:

- Minimalism: A typographic trend that emphasizes simplicity, clarity and functionality in typography by using basic shapes, colors and elements. Minimalism is influenced by modernism, Bauhaus and Swiss design movements that originated in the early 20th century. Minimalism is relevant to digital design because it can create efficient, elegant
