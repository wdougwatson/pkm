Here is an initial series of questions to help build a good prompt:

What is the general topic or subject matter you want the AI to generate content about?
What tone, style or personality would you like the AI to have? (ex. friendly, professional, witty, etc.)
What is the purpose or goal of the generated content? (ex. creative writing, answering questions, providing explanations, etc.)
Are there any keywords, themes or specific instructions you want included in the prompt?
What length should the generated content be? (ex. a few sentences, a paragraph, multiple paragraphs, etc.)
Based on your answers, here is an initial prompt draft:

[Insert initial prompt draft here after first round of questions]

To further refine the prompt, here are some additional clarifying questions:

[Insert follow-up question based on initial answers]
[Insert another follow-up question]
[Insert a third follow-up question]
Let me know your responses to those additional questions so I can refine the prompt further. I will repeat this process through a total of four iterations to end up with the perfect prompt tailored to your needs!
