OK, let's continue with the next project.

# Project 2: Create a poster for a typography event using Fonty

Fonty is a free Android app that allows you to create your own fonts by drawing, cutting, splicing and adding clipart. You can also preview, export and test your fonts with the Fonty keyboard. It supports over 15 languages and alphabets and has various brushes and stickers to enhance your fonts.

In this project, you will use Fonty to create a poster for a typography event. A poster is a graphic design that combines text and images to promote or advertise an event, product or service. A poster should be eye-catching, informative and appealing to the target audience and the purpose of the event.

Here are the steps to create a poster for a typography event using Fonty:

- Step 1: Open Fonty and tap on the plus icon to create a new font. Choose a name for your font (for example, Typo) and a language or alphabet for your font (for example, English). You can also choose a template or a base font to start with or draw your own letters from scratch.
- Step 2: Tap on the letter icon to add letters to your font. You can choose from uppercase, lowercase, numbers or symbols. You can also import letters from your device or Google Fonts.
- Step 3: Tap on the letter again to edit its shape. You can use the draw tool to draw your letter with different brushes, colors and sizes. You can also use the cut tool to cut out parts of your letter or the splice tool to join parts of different letters. You can also use the clipart tool to add stickers or icons to your letter.
- Step 4: Tap on the preview icon to preview your font. You can see how your font looks in different sizes, colors and backgrounds. You can also test your font with the Fonty keyboard by typing any text you want. You can also export your font as a TTF file or share it online.
- Step 5: Open any photo editing app that supports custom fonts (for example, PixelLab) and create a new project. Choose a portrait canvas size (1080 x 1920 pixels) and a background color or image that suits your event's theme.
- Step 6: Import your font from Fonty to the photo editing app. You can do this by tapping on the text icon and choosing the import option. Then, browse your device for the TTF file that you exported from Fonty and select it.
- Step 7: Add text to your canvas using your font. Type the name of your event (for example, Typo Fest) and choose a large size (for example, 200 pt) and a bright color (for example, yellow) for your text. You can also adjust the alignment, spacing and effects of your text using the sliders or the buttons.
- Step 8: Add more text to your canvas using other fonts. Type some details about your event, such as the date, time, location and speakers. Choose smaller sizes (for example, 50 pt) and darker colors (for example, black) for these texts. You can also use different fonts for these texts, such as serif, sans serif or script fonts. You can browse or import fonts from Google Fonts or other sources.
- Step 9: Arrange your text layers on your canvas. You can drag and drop the layers to change their order or position. You can also resize, rotate or flip the layers by using the handles or the buttons. Arrange your text layers until you create a clear and attractive composition.
- Step 10: Save your poster to your device or share it online. You can choose from different formats, such as PNG, JPG or PDF, and different resolutions, such as low, medium or high.

Congratulations! You have created a poster for a typography event using Fonty. Here is an example of how your poster might look like:
