# Great, here is the prompt updated to focus on digital typography:

# Write an extremely detailed, comprehensive and verbose typography tutorial aimed at absolute beginners who have no prior knowledge of typography or design. Start from the very basics and progress to pro-level knowledge of digital typography. Explain all terminology, concepts and techniques in an easy to understand yet highly informational tone and style. Go in-depth on topics like the anatomy of type, classifications and terminology, principles of typography, using type effectively, typographic hierarchies, pairing fonts, typographic design for digital mediums and applications, typographic trends and history relevant to digital design, developing an eye for good digital typography, and any other relevant topics that should be covered in a complete guide to mastering digital typography from start to finish.

Here are further clarifying questions for the next round of refinements:

Should the tutorial cover typography for website design, app design, social media, or a combination?
Do you want the tutorial to provide examples or walkthroughs of implementing typography in actual digital interfaces?
Any specific digital applications or tools you want covered (ex. Photoshop, CSS, etc)?
