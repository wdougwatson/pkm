Here's another attempt at consolidating all the information coherently:

In the early 20th century, some prolific pulp fiction writers utilized simple plot wheel devices to help generate ideas and scenarios for their fast-paced, plot-driven stories. These rudimentary storytelling aids took various forms:

The Plot Wheel: Invented by Doc Savage author Lester Dent, this wheel was divided into introduction, development, climax and resolution sections. Dent would spin the wheel and answer plot advancement questions in each section.

The Plot Genie: Created by Wycliffe A. Hill in the 1930s, this tool used spinning wheels and reference books of character types, settings, situations and climaxes that could be randomly combined into plot outlines, especially for mystery and romance stories. 

Customized Plot Wheels: Prolific authors like Erle Stanley Gardner (Perry Mason legal thrillers) and Walter B. Gibson (The Shadow novels) designed their own personalized plot wheels catered to their genres and characters. These featured categories like characters, motives, clues, complications, solutions, etc. that could be spun to generate scenarios.

Edgar Wallace was an early adopter of the plot wheel, even patenting his own version. But other famous genre writers like Agatha Christie continued creating intricate whodunits without such devices.

While plot wheels are not as common today, some contemporary authors have used simplified digital versions or their own hand-drawn tools to map out events and characters in complex long-form narratives like J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter, George R.R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire and Stephenie Meyer's Twilight. Their usage has evolved from rigid writing aids to optional spurs for creativity.

Additionally, some writers utilize tropes and conventions specific to genres like science fiction, fantasy, mystery, romance and westerns when crafting stories. Combining character archetypes, settings, conflicts and plot devices from different genres can yield fresh takes. For example, blending fantasy creatures with a murder mystery plot creates an intriguing urban fantasy premise. An understanding of genre tropes allows writers to meet audience expectations while also providing novelty.

So in summary, while helpful in their time, plot wheels were never essential to crafting great genre fiction. Their prevalence highlighted the prioritization of high-concept plots over nuanced storytelling. Today, most writers view them as creative prompts rather than substitutes for skill and imagination in developing compelling narratives using genre conventions and tropes.
