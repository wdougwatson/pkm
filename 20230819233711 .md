OK, let's continue with the next project.

# Project 4: Create a typographic poem using Creative Typography Design

Creative Typography Design is a free Android app that helps you to design beautiful typography with over 200 fonts, gradients, textures and stickers. You can also apply filters, adjust brightness, contrast, saturation and blur to your images. It also has a text art feature that lets you create text with various shapes and patterns.

In this project, you will use Creative Typography Design to create a typographic poem. A typographic poem is a poem that uses typography as a creative and expressive element to enhance the meaning and emotion of the words. A typographic poem should be original, artistic and meaningful to the theme or topic of your choice.

Here are the steps to create a typographic poem using Creative Typography Design:

- Step 1: Open Creative Typography Design and tap on the plus icon to create a new project. Choose a square canvas size (1080 x 1080 pixels) and a background color or image that suits your theme or topic.
- Step 2: Tap on the text icon to add text to your canvas. Type a word or a phrase that relates to your theme or topic (for example, Dream) and choose a font that matches your style and mood. You can browse the fonts by category or use the search bar to find a specific font.
- Step 3: Tap on the text again to edit its properties. You can adjust the color, size, alignment and spacing of your text using the sliders or the buttons. You can also apply gradients, textures or stickers to your text by tapping on the gradient, texture or sticker icons. Experiment with different settings until you are satisfied with your text.
- Step 4: Tap on the text art icon to create text art with your text. You can choose from various shapes and patterns, such as circles, squares, triangles, hearts, stars or flowers. You can also adjust the density, rotation and randomness of your text art using the sliders or the buttons. Experiment with different settings until you are satisfied with your text art.
- Step 5: Repeat steps 2 to 4 to add more words or phrases to your canvas. You can use different fonts, colors, gradients, textures, stickers and shapes for each word or phrase. You can also use different sizes and positions for each word or phrase. Try to create a visual rhythm and harmony with your words and phrases.
- Step 6: Tap on the layer icon to arrange your text and text art layers. You can drag and drop the layers to change their order or position. You can also resize, rotate or flip the layers by using the handles or the buttons. You can also group or ungroup the layers by tapping on the group icon. Arrange your text and text art layers until you create an interesting and attractive composition.
- Step 7: Tap on the save icon to save your typographic poem to your device or share it online. You can choose from different formats, such as PNG, JPG or PDF, and different resolutions, such as low, medium or high.
