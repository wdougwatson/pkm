Sure, I can help you with that. Here are some project examples that you can try to apply the tools and techniques that you learned from the tutorial. These projects are designed to help you practice and improve your typography skills and creativity in different digital mediums and applications.

## Project 1: Create a logo for a typography app using PixelLab

PixelLab is a free Android app that allows you to add text to your pictures with over 100 fonts, 3D text effects, stickers, shapes and backgrounds. You can also customize the color, size, stroke, shadow, alignment and spacing of your text. It also has a built-in photo editor and a meme generator².

In this project, you will use PixelLab to create a logo for a typography app. A logo is a graphic symbol or mark that represents a brand or a product. A logo should be simple, memorable, distinctive and relevant to the target audience and the purpose of the app.

Here are the steps to create a logo for a typography app using PixelLab:

- Step 1: Open PixelLab and tap on the plus icon to create a new project. Choose a square canvas size (1080 x 1080 pixels) and a transparent background.
- Step 2: Tap on the text icon to add text to your canvas. Type the name of your app (for example, Typo) and choose a font that suits your app's style and personality. You can browse the fonts by category or use the search bar to find a specific font. You can also import your own fonts from your device or Google Fonts⁴.
- Step 3: Tap on the text again to edit its properties. You can adjust the color, size, stroke, shadow, alignment and spacing of your text using the sliders or the buttons. You can also apply 3D effects, such as extrude, emboss or inflate, by tapping on the 3D icon. Experiment with different settings until you are satisfied with your text.
- Step 4: Tap on the shape icon to add a shape to your canvas. Choose a shape that complements your text and your app's theme. You can choose from basic shapes, such as circles, squares or triangles, or more complex shapes, such as stars, hearts or arrows. You can also import your own shapes from your device or use the draw tool to create custom shapes.
- Step 5: Tap on the shape again to edit its properties. You can adjust the color, size, stroke, shadow, alignment and spacing of your shape using the sliders or the buttons. You can also apply 3D effects, such as extrude, emboss or inflate, by tapping on the 3D icon. Experiment with different settings until you are satisfied with your shape.
- Step 6: Tap on the layer icon to arrange your text and shape layers. You can drag and drop the layers to change their order or position. You can also resize, rotate or flip the layers by using the handles or the buttons. You can also group or ungroup the layers by tapping on the group icon. Arrange your text and shape layers until you create a balanced and harmonious composition.
- Step 7: Tap on the save icon to save your logo to your device or share it online. You can choose from different formats, such as PNG, JPG or PDF, and different resolutions, such as low, medium or high. You can also add a watermark or remove it by tapping on the watermark icon.

Congratulations! You have created a logo for a typography app using PixelLab. Here is an example of how your logo might look like:
