# Generate a series of questions for me to answer in order to iteratively build the perfect prompt.

Considering my answers, generate an initial prompt and further clarifying questions that you will use for your next iteration of the prompt.

Continue to repeat and refine through four iterations, until finally generating the perfect prompt.

Here is an initial series of questions to help build a good prompt:

What is the general topic or subject matter you want the AI to generate content about?
What tone, style or personality would you like the AI to have? (ex. friendly, professional, witty, etc.)
What is the purpose or goal of the generated content? (ex. creative writing, answering questions, providing explanations, etc.)
Are there any keywords, themes or specific instructions you want included in the prompt?
What length should the generated content be? (ex. a few sentences, a paragraph, multiple paragraphs, etc.)
Based on your answers, here is an initial prompt draft:

[Insert initial prompt draft here after first round of questions]

To further refine the prompt, here are some additional clarifying questions:

[Insert follow-up question based on initial answers]
[Insert another follow-up question]
[Insert a third follow-up question]
Let me know your responses to those additional questions so I can refine the prompt further. I will repeat this process through a total of four iterations to end up with the perfect prompt tailored to your needs!

general topic or subject matter: typography tutorial from beginner to pro starting with no knowledge of typography or design.

Thanks for the initial details. Here is a draft of the first iteration prompt:

Write an extremely detailed, comprehensive and verbose typography tutorial aimed at absolute beginners who have no prior knowledge of typography or design. Start from the very basics and progress to pro-level typography knowledge. Explain all terminology, concepts and techniques in an easy to understand yet highly informational tone and style. Go in-depth on topics like the anatomy of type, classifications and terminology, principles of typography, using type effectively, typographic hierarchies, pairing fonts, typographic design for various mediums and applications, typographic trends and history, developing an eye for good typography, and any other relevant topics that should be covered in a complete guide to mastering typography from start to finish.

To further refine this, here are some additional questions:

Should the tutorial focus on typography for print design, digital design, or both?
Do you have a target length or word count in mind for the full tutorial?
Are there any specific applications, mediums or uses of typography you want to make sure are covered?
Let me know your thoughts and I'll refine the prompt further for the next iteration!
