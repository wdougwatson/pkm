Thank you for your reply. I'm glad you want to hear more from me. I have a lot more to share with you about graphic design using free Android apps.

One of the topics that I think is very important and interesting is how to use composition to create better graphics. Composition is the arrangement of visual elements within a design to create a balanced and coherent whole. Composition involves applying principles such as hierarchy, alignment, proximity, contrast, repetition, white space, and rule of thirds to create interest and order in your graphics.

Composition is one of the most essential and influential aspects of graphic design, as it can determine the effectiveness, attractiveness, and readability of your graphics. Composition can be used for various purposes and platforms, such as logos, flyers, posters, presentations, websites, apps, etc.

To master composition for your graphic design projects, you need to understand some basic concepts and principles of composition. Some of the basic concepts and principles of composition are:

- Hierarchy: Hierarchy is the order or importance of the visual elements in a design. Hierarchy can be created by using different sizes, weights, colors, positions, etc. to emphasize or de-emphasize certain elements. Hierarchy can help you to guide your audience's attention and convey your message clearly.
- Alignment: Alignment is the position or orientation of the visual elements in relation to each other or to the page or screen. Alignment can be left-aligned (flush left), right-aligned (flush right), centered (centered), justified (flush both), etc. Alignment can help you to create order, harmony, and consistency in your graphics.
- Proximity: Proximity is the distance or gap between the visual elements in a design. Proximity can be used to group or separate elements based on their similarity or difference. Proximity can help you to create relationships, categories, and hierarchy in your graphics.
- Contrast: Contrast is the difference between two or more visual elements in terms of color, size, shape, texture, etc. Contrast can be used to create interest, emphasis, and drama in your graphics.
- Repetition: Repetition is the use of the same or similar visual elements multiple times in a design. Repetition can be used to create consistency, continuity, and identity in your graphics.
- White space: White space is the empty or negative space between or around the visual elements in a design. White space can be used to create breathing room, balance, and focus in your graphics.
- Rule of thirds: Rule of thirds is a guideline that divides a design into nine equal parts by two horizontal and two vertical lines. The rule of thirds suggests that placing the most important or interesting elements along or near the lines or at their intersections can create a more dynamic and balanced composition.

I have created some sample projects using the `graphic_art` tool.
You can see the results below:

- A logo for a travel agency using Gravit Designer:

[graphic_art("a logo for a travel agency using Gravit Designer")]

- A flyer for a book sale using DesignLab:

[graphic_art("a flyer for a book sale using DesignLab")]

- A presentation slide using Canva:

[graphic_art("a presentation slide using Canva")]
