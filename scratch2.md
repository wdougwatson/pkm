Title: The Game of Destiny: Chess, Prophecy, and Magic in David Eddings’ Pawn of Prophecy

Abstract: This paper is a literary analysis of the first book in the fantasy series The Belgariad by David Eddings, titled Pawn of Prophecy. The paper examines the main themes, characters, plot, and setting of the book, as well as its relation to the genre of high fantasy and the influence of J.R.R. Tolkien. The paper also discusses the use of chess terminology and prophecy as narrative devices, and the role of magic and religion in the book's world.

Study: The paper begins with a brief summary of the book's prologue, which introduces the creation of the world by seven gods, the fashioning of the Orb of Aldur by the eldest god, and the theft of the Orb by the evil god Torak. The paper then follows the main character, Garion, a young farm boy who is unaware of his true identity and destiny, as he embarks on a quest to recover the Orb with his aunt Polgara, a powerful sorceress, his grandfather Belgarath, a legendary sorcerer, and several other companions. The paper analyzes how Garion's character develops throughout the book, as he learns more about his heritage, his abilities, and his role in the prophecy that foretells the fate of the world. The paper also explores how Garion's relationships with other characters shape his personality and worldview, especially with Polgara, Belgarath, Durnik, a loyal blacksmith, and Ce'Nedra, a spoiled princess.

The paper then moves on to discuss the main themes of the book, such as the conflict between good and evil, the importance of free will and choice, the value of friendship and loyalty, and the power of love and family. The paper also compares and contrasts the book with other works of high fantasy, such as The Lord of the Rings by J.R.R. Tolkien, which Eddings has acknowledged as an inspiration for his series. The paper examines how Eddings borrows some elements from Tolkien's work, such as the quest motif, the creation myth, and the races and cultures of his world, but also how he adds his own originality and creativity to his story. The paper highlights Eddings' use of humor, dialogue, and characterization to make his characters more realistic and relatable than Tolkien's.

The paper also explores how Eddings uses chess terminology and prophecy as narrative devices to structure his plot and foreshadow future events. The paper explains how each book in the series is named after a chess move and a fantasy term that relate to its content. For example, Pawn of Prophecy refers to Garion's role as a pawn in the game of destiny that is played by the gods and their agents. The paper also analyzes how Eddings uses prophecy as a source of mystery and suspense in his story, as well as a way to challenge his characters' beliefs and actions. The paper argues that Eddings does not present prophecy as a deterministic force that controls everything, but rather as a guide that can be interpreted in different ways.

Finally, the paper discusses how Eddings portrays magic and religion in his book's world. The paper describes how magic is depicted as a natural force that can be manipulated by those who have a special talent for it. The paper also explains how magic is linked to one's willpower and morality, as well as one's allegiance to a specific god. The paper then examines how religion is portrayed as a complex and diverse phenomenon that varies across different regions and cultures. The paper shows how Eddings depicts both positive and negative aspects of religion in his story, such as faith, devotion, tolerance, fanaticism, corruption, and violence.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by summarizing its main points and evaluating Pawn of Prophecy as an engaging and entertaining work of high fantasy that combines elements from traditional myths and legends with original ideas and characters. The paper praises Eddings' skillful storytelling and vivid imagination that create a rich and immersive world for his readers to explore. The paper also acknowledges some limitations and criticisms of Eddings' work, such as its lack of diversity and representation of women and minorities, its reliance on stereotypes and clichés, and its simplistic moral dichotomy. The paper suggests some possible directions for further research on Eddings' series and its impact on the genre of fantasy literature.
