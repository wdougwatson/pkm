Here is one way to remove redundancies and make the text more coherent:

Plot wheels, also known as story wheels, were devices used by pulp fiction writers in the early 20th century to generate story ideas randomly. These simple tools consisted of charts with plot elements like settings, characters, and events that could be spun to create unique combinations for fast-paced genre tales. 

Some well-known authors who utilized plot wheels were Edgar Wallace, Erle Stanley Gardner, and Walter B. Gibson. Wallace, a prolific British crime writer, invented his own patented plot wheel that churned out random scenarios for his stories. Gardner, who wrote the famous Perry Mason legal thrillers, had four customized plot wheels that helped him devise clever twists for his courtroom dramas. Gibson was the creator of the iconic pulp hero The Shadow and wrote over 300 Shadow novels using his set of four plot wheels to concoct plots involving mysterious characters, motives, clues, and situations.

While not as widely used today, some contemporary writers still employ plot wheels or online plot generators as creative prompts and exercises. J.K. Rowling mapped out her Harry Potter novels on handwritten plot wheels. George R.R. Martin outlined his initial A Song of Ice and Fire trilogy on a wheel before expanding it. Stephenie Meyer used a plot wheel to plan the events of the first Twilight book.

In summary, plot wheels were once essential tools for prolific genre writers looking to churn out countless stories, though they tended to provide more of a basic framework. Today, many novelists view them as helpful but nonessential generators of ideas and scenarios rather than a substitute for skill and imagination in crafting compelling narratives. Their usage has evolved from a rigid writing aid to an optional spur for creativity.
