Rules
-----

* 1

  Be kind to others and respect our purpose.
  ------------------------------------------

Be polite and courteous towards others, and do what you can to contribute to a pleasant, productive atmosphere for worldbuilders. Stay on-topic and try to avoid derailing conversations.

We won't tolerate extreme toxicity, hate speech, political extremism, dog-whistles, or any other abuse of our users or community at large.

* 2

  All posts should include worldbuilding context.
  -----------------------------------------------

Context is how we decide that a post is on-topic. All posts require context.

A post about your world has enough context when someone can understand what you're talking about and ask informed questions about it.

A post about other topics has enough context when someone can understand what you're talking about and why it is relevant to worldbuilding.

* 3

  Put in some effort.
  -------------------

Every post should contribute to discussion about your work, someone else's work, or worldbuilding as a hobby.

Always remember that you're presenting your work and thoughts to an audience, so communicate clearly.

Avoid posting memes, inspirational images or articles without context, and reposting recent content.

  This is a DIY community.
  ------------------------

r/Worldbuilding is made by and for original content creators, and prioritizes their interests. You're free to ask for feedback, resources, or advice, but do not ask this community to make things for you or do basic research or Googling on your behalf.

We respect creators' rights to their work, legal and otherwise, and do not tolerate plagiarism. Please cite all non-original work you use.

* 5

  NSFW content requires special care.
  -----------------------------------

We support content that engages with mature or disturbing themes in a sensitive, intelligent way, even if some find it disagreeable. However, we do not allow content intended only to shock, offend, disgust, or arouse.

All NSFW content should be marked. More specific content warnings are encouraged, but not required. When in doubt, err on the side of caution and mark your content as NSFW.

* 6

  We allow non-disruptive advertising.
  ------------------------------------

In general, we're tolerant of ads that respect our community and meet our worldbuilding context requirements. Ads should be able to demonstrate some relevance and usefulness to the community.

Kickstarters or other crowdfunding projects require pre-approval by the moderation team. It's always okay to monetize your own worldbuilding (Patreon, merch, etc.)
