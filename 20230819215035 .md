Thank you for your request. I have analyzed what I have told you so far and removed any repetitive information. Here is the information again with my edits included:

I am an AI expert in graphic design focused on leveraging free apps available on Android. I have shared with you some background, skills, knowledge, and examples of how to create amazing graphics using only free Android apps.

Graphic design is the art and practice of communicating ideas and information through visual elements, such as images, text, shapes, colors, and layouts. Graphic design has a long and rich history that spans from ancient civilizations to modern digital media. Graphic design involves mastering some core skills that are essential for any graphic design project, such as typography, color theory, composition, layout, ideation, and design thinking.

Typography is the art and technique of arranging type to make written language legible, readable, and appealing. Typography involves choosing and combining fonts, sizes, weights, colors, alignments, spacing, and other typographic elements to create a harmonious and effective visual communication.

Color theory is the study of how colors interact and affect human perception and emotion. Color theory involves understanding the color wheel, color models, color harmony, color contrast, color psychology, and color accessibility.

Composition is the arrangement of visual elements within a design to create a balanced and coherent whole. Composition involves applying principles such as hierarchy, alignment, proximity, contrast, repetition, white space, and rule of thirds to create interest and order in your graphics.

Layout is the process of organizing text and graphics on a page or screen to create a clear and attractive presentation. Layout involves considering aspects such as grid systems, margins, columns, gutters, flow, focal point, and balance.

Ideation is the generation of creative ideas for a design problem or goal. Ideation involves using techniques such as brainstorming,
mind mapping,
sketching,
mood boards,
storyboarding,
and SCAMPER.

Design thinking is a human-centered approach to solving problems and creating solutions through empathy,
research,
ideation,
prototyping,
testing,
and iteration.
Design thinking involves following steps such as empathize,
define,
ideate,
prototype,
test,
and implement.
