OK, let's continue with the next project.

## Project 3: Create a typographic artwork using Font Studio

Font Studio is a free Android app that allows you to add text to your photos with over 120 fonts, 40 filters, 200 stickers and 100 backgrounds. You can also edit your photos with crop, rotate, flip and adjust tools. It also has a collage maker and a magazine cover maker.

In this project, you will use Font Studio to create a typographic artwork. A typographic artwork is a graphic design that uses text as the main or only element to create a visual expression or message. A typographic artwork should be creative, original and meaningful to the theme or topic of your choice.

Here are the steps to create a typographic artwork using Font Studio:

- Step 1: Open Font Studio and tap on the plus icon to create a new project. Choose a landscape canvas size (1920 x 1080 pixels) and a background color or image that suits your theme or topic.
- Step 2: Tap on the text icon to add text to your canvas. Type a word or a phrase that relates to your theme or topic (for example, Love) and choose a font that matches your style and mood. You can browse the fonts by category or use the search bar to find a specific font. You can also import your own fonts from your device or Google Fonts.
- Step 3: Tap on the text again to edit its properties. You can adjust the color, size, stroke, shadow, alignment and spacing of your text using the sliders or the buttons. You can also apply filters, such as blur, glow or sketch, by tapping on the filter icon. Experiment with different settings until you are satisfied with your text.
- Step 4: Tap on the sticker icon to add stickers to your canvas. Choose stickers that complement or contrast with your text and your theme or topic. You can choose from various categories, such as animals, flowers, emojis or symbols. You can also import your own stickers from your device or use the draw tool to create custom stickers.
- Step 5: Tap on the sticker again to edit its properties. You can adjust the color, size, stroke, shadow, alignment and spacing of your sticker using the sliders or the buttons. You can also apply filters, such as blur, glow or sketch, by tapping on the filter icon. Experiment with different settings until you are satisfied with your sticker.
- Step 6: Tap on the layer icon to arrange your text and sticker layers. You can drag and drop the layers to change their order or position. You can also resize, rotate or flip the layers by using the handles or the buttons. You can also group or ungroup the layers by tapping on the group icon. Arrange your text and sticker layers until you create an interesting and attractive composition.
- Step 7: Tap on the save icon to save your typographic artwork to your device or share it online. You can choose from different formats, such as PNG, JPG or PDF, and different resolutions, such as low, medium or high.

Congratulations! You have created a typographic artwork using Font Studio. Here is an example of how your typographic artwork might look like:
