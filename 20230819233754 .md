OK, let's continue with the next project.

# Project 7: Create a typographic meme using PixelLab and Creative Typography Design

PixelLab is a free Android app that allows you to add text to your pictures with over 100 fonts, 3D text effects, stickers, shapes and backgrounds. You can also customize the color, size, stroke, shadow, alignment and spacing of your text. It also has a built-in photo editor and a meme generator.

Creative Typography Design is a free Android app that helps you to design beautiful typography with over 200 fonts, gradients, textures and stickers. You can also apply filters, adjust brightness, contrast, saturation and blur to your images. It also has a text art feature that lets you create text with various shapes and patterns.

In this project, you will use PixelLab and Creative Typography Design to create a typographic meme. A typographic meme is a meme that uses typography as a humorous or sarcastic element to convey a message or an idea. A typographic meme should be funny, witty and relevant to the theme or topic of your choice.

Here are the steps to create a typographic meme using PixelLab and Creative Typography Design:

- Step 1: Open PixelLab and tap on the plus icon to create a new project. Choose a square canvas size (1080 x 1080 pixels) and a background color or image that suits your theme or topic.
- Step 2: Tap on the text icon to add text to your canvas. Type a word or a phrase that relates to your theme or topic (for example, Typo) and choose a font that matches your style and mood. You can browse the fonts by category or use the search bar to find a specific font. You can also import your own fonts from your device or Google Fonts.
- Step 3: Tap on the text again to edit its properties. You can adjust the color, size, stroke, shadow, alignment and spacing of your text using the sliders or the buttons. You can also apply 3D effects, such as extrude, emboss or inflate, by tapping on the 3D icon. Experiment with different settings until you are satisfied with your text.
- Step 4: Tap on the sticker icon to add stickers to your canvas. Choose stickers that complement or contrast with your text and your theme or topic. You can choose from various categories, such as animals, flowers, emojis or symbols. You can also import your own stickers from your device or use the draw tool to create custom stickers.
- Step 5: Tap on the sticker again to edit its properties. You can adjust the color, size, stroke, shadow, alignment and spacing of your sticker using the sliders or the buttons. You can also apply filters, such as blur, glow or sketch, by tapping on the filter icon. Experiment with different settings until you are satisfied with your sticker.
- Step 6: Tap on the layer icon to arrange your text and sticker layers. You can drag and drop the layers to change their order or position. You can also resize, rotate or flip the layers by using the handles or the buttons. You can also group or ungroup the layers by tapping on the group icon. Arrange your text and sticker layers until you create an interesting and attractive composition.
- Step 7: Tap on the save icon to save your typographic meme to your device or share it online. You can choose from different formats, such as PNG, JPG or PDF, and different resolutions, such as low, medium or high.
- Step 8: Open Creative Typography Design and tap on the plus icon to create a new project. Choose a square canvas size (1080 x 1080 pixels) and a transparent background.
