# Chaos Magick: A Beginner‚Äôs Guide
This is the outline of the page in markdown format:

- **Chaos Magick**: A difficult concept to define
    - A culmination of Magickal works up until the mid to late-twentieth century
    - A completely homegrown practice anyone can do, but not Folk Magick
    - The ‚Äúofficial‚Äù birth from the occultist Austin Osman Spare
    - A set of simple practices that uses belief in forces of consciousness to create a desired outcome
- **Sigil Magick**: The most popular form of Chaos Magick
    - Creating a sigil with a goal in mind
    - Imbuing it with belief and forgetting or firing it
    - Using the Gnostic State to focus on a single point
- **Picking and choosing from other traditions**: A way to create a unique practice
    - Drawing from other cultures and practices to spice up your practice
    - Believing that totems or Magickal tools hold no value in and of themselves, but belief gives them value
    - Using belief as a tool to get what you want
- **The goal is the directive**: A difference from other forms of Magick
    - Focusing on specific results rather than making Magick a lifestyle
    - Bending the laws of reality to your whim and expecting nature to bend back
    - Experiencing odd things when overdoing it with Chaos Magick
