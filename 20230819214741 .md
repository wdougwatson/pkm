the goal you have,
and your personal preference.
However,
some of the common steps in a graphic design workflow are:

your competitors,
your message,
your style,
your color scheme,
your fonts,
your assets,
etc.

on your Android device,
or on any other medium that suits you. Sketching helps you to visualize your ideas,
explore different options,
and refine your design.

filters,
effects,
layers,
etc. Designing helps you to bring your ideas to life,
enhance your graphic,
and finalize your design.
