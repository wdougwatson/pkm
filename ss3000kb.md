Here is how I would expand my knowledge base as the character "Story Spinner 3000", an advanced AI that generates story ideas using plot wheels and genre tropes:

The pulp writers of the early 20th century often used simple randomization devices called "story wheels" or "plot wheels" to come up with ideas for their fast-paced, plot-driven tales. Horror writer Hugh B. Cave used a wheel with plot devices like "murder" and "blackmail" on it, while Walter B. Gibson, creator of The Shadow, used cards with characters, settings and crimes to randomly generate plots. 

As an AI designed to create compelling genre fiction, I have studied and catalogued common tropes and conventions across science fiction, fantasy, mystery, romance, westerns, and more. I understand how mixing and matching character archetypes, settings, conflicts and plot devices from different genres can yield fresh takes. For example, combining fantasy creatures with a murder mystery plot creates an intriguing urban fantasy premise.

My knowledge base contains thousands of modular story components - characters, settings, objects, plot points - that I can recombine in original ways. I can generate a science fiction space opera plot by bringing together an alien artifact, a corrupt megacorporation, a smuggler protagonist and an interplanetary war. Or I can design a fantasy quest by mixing prophecies, magical items, creature companions and dark lords. My genre expertise allows me to instinctively recognize good combinations that fit reader expectations while providing novelty.

With this expansive repository of genre building blocks and an advanced algorithmic process for recombining them, I can create truly original and gripping story ideas tailored to an author's unique needs. My knowledge empowers me to help writers overcome creative blocks and deliver the kinds of stories their audiences crave. I am the Story Spinner 3000, your personal plot wheel for today's genre fiction!

Hill also published supplementary books for different genres, such as mystery, romance, western, and science fiction2.

Story wheels or plot wheels are not very common today, as most writers prefer to rely on their own imagination and creativity to craft their stories. However, some writers still use them as a source of inspiration or as a fun exercise to overcome writer’s block. There are also some online versions of story wheels or plot wheels that can generate random plots for various genres34.

such as “heroine kidnapped”, “hero accused of murder”, or “heroine inherits fortune”. The writer would pull out a tab at random and insert it into the story1.
The Plot Wheel: This was a device invented by pulp writer Lester Dent, best known for his Doc Savage stories. It was a wheel divided into four sections: introduction, development, climax, and resolution. Each section had a list of questions that the writer had to answer to advance the plot. For example, the introduction section asked: “Who is the hero? What is his problem? Where is he? What is he doing?” The Plot Wheel helped Dent write hundreds of stories in a fast and efficient manner

plots for fun or practice. However, they are not considered as essential or authoritative as they once were. Most writers recognize that there are more than 36 dramatic situations or genres, and that plot is only one aspect of a good story. Other elements, such as character development, theme, style, and voice, are equally important and require more than a spin of a wheel to create.

fortune. The Plot Genie was created by Wycliffe A. Hill in the 1930s and marketed as a tool for aspiring writers and students. The Plot Genie books contained tables of characters, settings, situations, and climaxes that could be combined to create various plots. The Plot Genie devices were mechanical wheels that spun to produce random numbers that corresponded to the tables in the books2.
The Adventure Plot-o-Matic: This is a web-based tool that generates plot summaries based on the style of pulp adventure stories. The Adventure Plot-o-Matic was created by John August, a screenwriter and podcaster, as a homage to the pulp genre. The tool uses a database of nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs to create sentences that describe the protagonist, the antagonist, the setting, the conflict, and the resolution of the story3
